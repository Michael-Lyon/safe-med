   <media:description>ChatGPT is a content generating powerhouse. Whether you want it to create articles, scripts, stories, sales copy or emails everyone can agree it's a site that is disrupting the content generating industry. Making it easier than ever. However, it's not particularly easy for the newbie to jump in and get the MOST out of it. SO this little video i'm going to being showing you a cool hack, a well crafted prompt that you can edit and manipulate for your own purpose to get incredible result using ChatGPT.

The prompt (replace anything in brackets - explained in the video)

I would like to [state what you want created]. 

Can you [state what you want created]. 

It should be [explain the style]. 

It should [outline what it needs to include].

[Add any further details, the more the better]. 

Your response should be in two sections. 

The first being [state what you want created] and the second being three questions for me that you feel would improve the [state what you want created]. When I respond with the answers, you will rewrite the [state what you want created] and provide me with three further questions to make improvements. Repeat this process until I confirm that we are finished.
